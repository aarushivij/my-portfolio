          I love reading and explorirng new stuff literally about anything.
          Space, Computers, Science and Technology are some of my areas of my
          intersts.I have learnt C++ and Java programming languages. Apart from
          this I have worked on my Application Development skills and used it in making a
          Goal Setting Application<a href="https://github.com/aarushivij/done"
            >(Link to the repo)</a
          >

          a part of this exploration :p).

        <p class="about-paragraph">
          I am a passionate PotterHead and can talk about Harry Potter and the
          wizarding world to any extent. Luna Lovegood is my favorite HP
          character. She taught me that one should celebrate one's
          individuality.It's okay to be weird.
        </p>
        <p class="about-paragraph">
          I read books regularly which are generally motivational and
          inspirational kind of. I think reading such books , always remind me
          to stay positive and how can I always get the best out of my skills.
          This external motivating factor helps me alot.
        </p>
        <p class="about-paragraph">
          I love listening rock music and The Beatles is my favorite band.
          1960's bands and artists' works are the most I listen to. Favorite
          Beatles song is I Wanna Hold Your Hand. Though Hey Jude is my
          everegreen song( Na, na, na, na-na-na na Na-na-na na, hey Jude :P).
          Apart from Beatles I listen  songs of Queen , Elvis Presley ,
          John Elton etc.
